    "\n",
    "Before we can utilize text as features in a learning model, we need a concise mathematical way to represent things like words, phrases, sentences, etc.  The most common text models are based on the so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model\">Vector Space Model</a> (VSM) where individual words in a document are associated with entries of a vector: \n",

This vocabulary can be determined by looking at all (or most) of the words in the training set, or even by including a fixed vocabulary based on the english language.  A vector representation of a document like a movie review is then a vector with length $|V|$ where each entry in the vector maps uniquely to a word in the vocabulary. A vector encoding of a document would then be a vector that is nonzero in positions corresponding to words present in the document and zero everywhere else.  How you fill in the nonzero entries depends on the model you're using.  Two simple conventions are the **Bag-of-Words** model and the **binary** model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the binary model we simply set an entry of the vector to $1$ if the associate word appears at least once in the document.  In the more common Bag-of-Words model we set an entry of the vector equal to the frequency with which the word appears in the document. Let's see if we can come up with a simple implementation of the Bag-of-Words model in Python, and then later we'll see how sklearn can do the heavy lifting for us. \n",

I've partially cleaned the data and stored it in files called $\\texttt{labeledTrainData.tsv}$ and $\\texttt{labeledTestData.tsv}$ in the data directory. We'll load it and process it a bit more in the following cell. Note that we also implement the ability to remove stop words if we choose.  "
